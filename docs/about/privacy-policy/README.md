# Privacy Policy

## The Gist

- We use Google Analytics on this site to see how much traffic we're getting
  - We do not use analytics or trackers of any kind - including Google Analytics - within the Handsfree Chrome Extension
- We do not look at, transmit, or store the webcam feed in whole or in parts
  - All inference (computer vision) is done within your browser
  - Due to large file sizes, some models (currently just [Google's BodyPix](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/11/updated-bodypix-2.html)) are stored in remote Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). However, they are downloaded by your browser in order to run inference in the browser when needed
- The Handsfree Chrome Extension runs in a sandboxed environment, isolated from the pages you visit
  - The pages you visit handsfree cannot access your webcam feed or inference data (head pose, gestures, pointer position and states, etc)
  - Pages you visit that rely on the webcam still need you to accept permission to the webcam, even if you're already browsing the site handsfree

## Privacy Policy <small>- Updated December 27, 2019</small>

> **Please note:** We're currently using [a Privacy Policy template](https://app.termly.io/document/privacy-policy/f20f9a1f-7d01-484c-9c27-aea1e569d81d) below, with some modifications. Our policies may change as we develop this site, the Handsfree Chrome Extension, and Handsfree.js. Check back regularly or [follow us on Twitter @BrowseHandsfree](https://twitter.com/browsehandsfree) to learn when the policy changes.

Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at BrowseHandsfree ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [oz@browsehandsfree.com](mailto:oz@browsehandsfree.com).

When you visit our website [https://browsehandsfree.com](https://browsehandsfree.com), and use our services (The Handsfree Chrome Extension), you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Sites and our services.

This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our tools and website (such as with the [Handsfree Chrome Extension](/browser)), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy notice as the "Services").

**Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your personal information with us.**

## What information do we collect?

None.

<!-- ## Will your information be shared with anyone?

**In Short**: _We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations._

We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:

**Consent:** We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.

**Legitimate Interests:** We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.

**Performance of a Contract:** Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.

**Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).

**Vital Interests:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:

**Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

**Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

**Third-Party Advertisers.** We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Services. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. -->

## Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

**In Short:** _We use Google Analytics, but do not use cookies or other tracking technologies._

We use Google Analytics to measure basic traffic statistics to this site ([https://browsehandsfree.com](https://browsehandsfree.com)). We do not use Google Analytics, other trackers, or cookies within the Handsfree Chrome Extension.

<!-- ## How long do we keep your information?

**In Short:** _We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How do we keep your information safe?

**In Short:** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## Do we collect information from minors?

**In Short:** _We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [oz@browsehandsfree.com](mailto:oz@browsehandsfree.com). -->

<!-- ## What are your privacy rights?

**In Short:** _You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._

If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: [https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit [https://www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). -->

## Controls for Do-Not-Track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

<!-- ## Do California residents have specific privacy rights?

**In Short:** _Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems. -->

## Do we make updates to this policy?

**In Short:** _Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws._

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
