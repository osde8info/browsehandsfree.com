# Classes

The following classes are added to the `<body>` to help make styling your app easier:

```css
/* Added while handsfree is loading dependencies */

/* Added when handsfree is tracking */
.handsfree-started
```

The following are some helpers you can add to your elements:

```css
/* Hidden while loading */
.handsfree-hide-when-loading

/* Show while loading */
.handsfree-show-when-loading
```
