The following classes are added to the `<body>` to help make styling your app easier:

```css
/* Added while handsfree is loading dependencies */

The following are some helpers you can add to your elements:

```css
/* Hidden while loading */
.handsfree-hide-when-loading

/* Show while loading */
.handsfree-show-when-loading

/* Hide during different states */
.handsfree-show-when-stopped
.handsfree-show-when-started
```
