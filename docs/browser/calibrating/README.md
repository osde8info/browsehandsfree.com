You may sometimes find that the pointer isn't responding to you correctly, which can happen when the lighting changes or when you put on or take off things like glasses or hats. To recalibrate:

- Open up the dashboard
- Click "Calibrate Pointer"
- Click "Start Calibration"
- Point your forehead towards the marker (the big circle below the button)

After a few moments, the calibration marker will disappear and you should be calibrated.
